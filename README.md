From an early age, I've always had a passion for software development. My motivation to progress myself and overcome new challenges is drawn from the excitement of creating something. I've enjoyed working in the computer sector for over 13 years as a systems administrator, but I'm now looking for new experiences that will push me further.

My GitHub account has multiple working examples of Ruby, C#, Python and VB Script projects that are all open source. Some example of these projects are Twitter, Instagram, Yelp, Pacman and the bowling challenge. These examples all show good software craftsmanship such as the SOLID principles, Object Orientated Design, XP values, clean DRY code and RESTful API’s.

I am competent in using Test Driven Design frameworks such as Rspec, Capybara and Jasmine and have even written my own test framework using Javascript. I can work in an agile environment and take part in daily stand ups, weekly retrospectives and regular code reviews in order to help others and to better myself.

I am also competent in frameworks such as Sinatra, Rails, node server and am highly efficient in MVC architecture. I have over 10 years’ commercial experience of MS SQL Server, Oracle databases using CRUD commands, MS Server, MS Exchange, MS MDT, Windows support and I am an Oracle Certified Associate.

I have worked effectively as part of a team, paired programming or individually using version control through GitHub. I believe I am a well-rounded team member that will fit into your organisation with minimal disruption. I have commercial experience in the whole software development life cycle producing software such as a web based version of a room booking system, Virtual Learning Environment and a First Aid logging system.

### Fast Learner
The ability to take a pragmatic and considered approach to problem-solving has enabled me to adopt and utilise new skills and concepts quickly and efficiently throughout my career. During the Makers Academy course we learnt several technologies and frameworks in a short space of time. This meant that I had to adapt quickly soaking up each aspect.

### Working Under Pressure
During my previous employment I often found myself in high pressure situations. My measured and calm approach has enabled me to handle testing situations in an organised and methodical manner ensuring that all systems we’re working to their optimal performance.

### Communication
Working with a wide range of people in my previous roles, including teaching children computer skills as well as PSHE, has given me the confidence to teach classes of 30 students and entire year assemblies. I believe communication is key to a successful working relationship whether it's explaining a tricky technical concept to somebody, giving a presentation, asking for assistance or even just providing an update on the current status of a project. I pride myself on my ability to tailor my approach to the target audience and preventing any miscommunication from occurring.

### Critical Reasoning and Problem Solving
I have a proven record of problem solving through my 13 years as a Systems Administrator. Systems were vital for the staff and students to perform to their best which meant that the system needed to be reliable and robust. Maintenance is key in reducing problems but an ability to provide a rapid response to any unforeseen events means that I've learnt to think quickly and calmly, finding the correct solution despite often stressful circumstances.
