I have always had a passion for software development from an early age, the excitement of creating something drives me to progress myself and overcome new challenges. I have worked in the computer sector for over 13 years as a systems administrator, which I’ve enjoyed but now I’m looking for new experiences that will push me further.

Having graduated Makers Academy, an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp focused primarily on Ruby and Javascript, I am excited by the prospect of joining a company where I can make a real difference as a junior developer.

During my time at Makers Academy I learned how to think like a programmer, write clean test-driven code, and the ability to learn new languages and technologies efficiently in a short period of time. As such, I am extremely comfortable when it comes to test-driven development, agile methodologies and XP values.

### Fast Learner
The ability to take a pragmatic and considered approach to problem-solving has enabled me to adopt and utilise new skills and concepts quickly and efficiently throughout my career. During the Makers Academy course we learnt several technologies and frameworks in a short space of time. This meant that I had to adapt quickly soaking up each aspect.

### Working Under Pressure
During my previous employment I often found myself in high pressure situations. My measured and calm approach enabled me to handle testing situations in an organised and methodical manner ensuring that all systems we’re working to their optimal performance.

### Communication
In my previous roles I have worked with a wide range people including teaching children not only computer skills but PSHE. It gave me the confidence to teach in front of a class of 30 and to a whole year assembly. I believe communication is key to a successful working relationship whether it's explaining a tricky technical concept to somebody, giving a presentation, asking for assistance or even just providing an update on the current status of a project I'm working on. I pride myself on my ability on to adjust my approach depending on the target audience and prevent any miscommunication from occurring.

### Critical Reasoning and Problem Solving
I have a proven record of problem solving through my 13 years as a Systems Administrator. Systems were vital for the staff and students to perform to their best which meant that the system needed to be reliable and robust. Maintenance was key to reduce problems but a rapid response was needed to fix anything unforeseen, which meant that I had to be a quick thinker and needed the skill of finding the correct solution in a stressful timeframe.
